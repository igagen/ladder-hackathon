PROBLEM: Facebook apps send POST request w/info we need for SS app, no hook yet

OPTIONS:
  hack server module (ugly, forks): works
  write our own proxy: works, but lame
  nginx POST to separate app that writes to redis: lame, because we want @session directly
  we punt on FB usernames and just let people have their own userid for the game
